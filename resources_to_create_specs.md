`
A software design document can be at the level of a system or component, and generally includes:

relevant goals or requirements (functional and non-functional);
static structure (e.g., components, interfaces, dependencies);
dynamic behavior (how components interacts);
data models or external interfaces (external to the system/component described in the document); and
deployment considerations (e.g., runtime requirements, third-party components).
Note that all of these descriptions are at an abstract level. The purpose is to give the reader a broad general understanding of the system or component. There may be many levels of design documents (e.g., system- or component-level).

A technical specification describes the minute detail of either all or specific parts of a design, such as:

the signature of an interface, including all data types/structures required (input data types, output data types, exceptions);
detailed class models including all methods, attributes, dependencies and associations;
the specific algorithms that a component employs and how they work; and
physical data models including attributes and types of each entity/data type.
