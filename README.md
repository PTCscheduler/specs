#How to consume this info
With all of the plethora of the information it's probably best to start [here] (https://github.com/PTCscheduler/specs/blob/master/generic_specV1.md) for a mostly english descripton of what this software should do. Or you can just dive into the database setup DRAFT [here] (https://github.com/PTCscheduler/specs/blob/master/databaseDRAFT1.md)
#Specs Files
